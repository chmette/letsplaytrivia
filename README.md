## About

Let play Trivia is a fun little project with use of an free [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for the React Module of DCI, made by [luke-dowling](https://github.com/luke-dowling) and [chmette](https://github.com/chmette).

The goal of the project was to practice the handling and receiving data from an API.
We wanted to have an interactive interface as we as a fun topic,so the idea of building a trivia game was born.

### About the Game

In a trivia game people are asked questions about interesting but unimportant facts in many subjects. You will also know it as pub quiz or trivia competitions.

Trivia combine learning and fun, it challenges you.
